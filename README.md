# Demand-Forecasting---Python

**Time-series Forecasting - Tableau Superstore dataset at Sub-Category level using ARIMA, LSTM, and Prophet with Python**

**About the Dataset**

    - You can download the dataset here: https://community.tableau.com/s/question/0D54T00000CWeX8SAL/sample-superstore-sales-excelxls
    - This dataset contains the sales details of different categories and subcategories from the year 2014 to 2017.

We will try to forecast a time series data by building three different model with Python, and inspect their resutls. 

Models we will use are as follows: 
    - **ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving average)**
    - **LSTM (Long Short Term Memory Neural Network)**
    - **Facebook Prophet**
      

**Other Details:**

   - **Operating systme:** Ubunut 18.04 LTS
   - **Programming language:** Python3.6
   - **Python programming library version**
       - Tensorflow: 1.14.0
       - Keras: 2.3.1
       - Matplotlib: 3.2.2
       - Plotly: 4.8.2
       - Seaborn: 0.10.1
       - Statsmodels: 0.11.1

**Note:** Do not forget they are just quick and basic predictions so we can improve these models with tuning and according to the availability of the dataset and business requirements.
