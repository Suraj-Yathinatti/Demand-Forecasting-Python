# Demand-Forecasting - Python

**Python, Time-series forecasting - Tableau Superstore dataset**

**About the Dataset**

    - You can download the dataset here
    https://community.tableau.com/s/question/0D54T00000CWeX8SAL/sample-superstore-sales-excelxls
    - This dataset contains the sales details of different categories and subcategories from 2014 to 2017.

We will try to forecast a time series data by building three different model with Python, and inspect their results. 

Models we will use are as follows: 

- **ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving average)**
- **LSTM (Long Short Term Memory Neural Network)**
- **Facebook Prophet**
      

**Other Details:**

   - **Operating System:** Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
   - **Programming language:** Python3.6
   - **Python programming library version**
       - Tensorflow: 1.14.0
       - Keras: 2.3.1
       - Matplotlib: 3.2.2
       - Plotly: 4.8.2
       - Seaborn: 0.10.1
       - Statsmodels: 0.11.1
